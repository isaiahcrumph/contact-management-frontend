⚙️ Frontend Setup Instructions

This is the React frontend for the Contacts Management App. It connects to an ASP.NET Core backend API and provides full CRUD functionality for managing contacts, along with authentication features.
📋 Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

    Node.js v22.14.0

    npm (comes with Node.js)

🚀 Getting Started

    Clone the frontend repo:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-frontend-repo.git
cd your-frontend-repo

    Install dependencies:

npm install

VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5173

    Adjust the API URL based on where your backend is running.

    Run the app:

npm run dev

This will start the Vite development server and open the app in your browser (usually at http://localhost:5173).
🧪 Running Tests

No tests are currently included.
💬 Notes

    Make sure your backend API is running at the same time for the frontend to connect successfully.

    This project is built with modern React and Vite for fast builds and hot reloading.
