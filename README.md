🚀 Contact Management Frontend

This is the React frontend for the Contact Management application. It connects to a .NET Core backend API and provides full CRUD functionality, user authentication, and a contact table interface.

Frontend Repo: isaiahcrumph/contact-management-frontend

Tech Stack: React (Vite) · Axios

Backend: .NET Core API (add link if available)

Database: SQL Server
📦 Requirements

Before running the app, ensure you have the following installed:

    Node.js v22.14.0
    Download Node.js

    npm (comes with Node)

🛠️ Installation & Setup

    Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/isaiahcrumph/contact-management-frontend.git
cd contact-management-frontend

    Install dependencies:

npm install

    Run the development server:

npm run dev

The app will be available at http://localhost:5173 by default.

    ⚠️ Ensure your backend API is running at the same time.
    If your frontend makes direct requests (e.g. via Axios), make sure the backend is reachable at the correct URL — typically http://localhost:5000 or whatever your ASP.NET server is using.

    This project is built with modern React and Vite for fast builds and hot reloading.
